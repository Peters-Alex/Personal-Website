Project Name: Personal Website
Project Status: Work in Progress
Project Description: This project was designed to help me explore GitHub and use the skills that I have aquired thus far to create my personal website that I will be used in a later section of the course. Things that I needed to consider for this project was to create a descriptive branch for git hub. Add More than one desciptive commit messages. Include a descriptive ReadMe file. Use correct and proper Syntax for a function website. Create three pages that consist of Home, Portfolio, and About me pages. Also, I needed to inclued and External CSS file for styling. Lastly, I needed to personalize the content to match my current skill level.  
Project Visuals: The visuals that I used during this project where screenshot of the work that I have submitted thus far. Also, I used a personal photo for my about me page. Overall, it might not seem impressive to my viewers. However, for me not knowing anything about code, it feels great to accomplish what I've done so far.
