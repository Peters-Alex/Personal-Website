        <h3>What Inspired Me </h3>
        <!--Insert Image-->
            <p>The spark that ignited my passion for software development was ignited when I was a technical recruiter at Artium Technologies. The more I learned about the world of software development, the deeper I fell into the hole of discovery and learning. The more I learned, the more I saw how my motivation and desire for continuous self-improvement aligned with software development.
